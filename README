Nupkux Distribution README file

----------Description

Nupkux is a try to create a Unix-alike kernel with some basic userspace
applications running on it. It is derived from "Nur plia kripla unikso,"
Esperanto for "Just another stunted Unix." There no will to reach this aim,
it is just a way of learning how computers and Unix-Systems work "under the
hood." 

----------Contents

There are tree main parts in this package:
	- Nupkux (the kernel) located in ./src
	- Userspace Applications and a small libc (./usr)
	- Tools related to Nupkux, help to build it (./tools)

----------Dependencies

I only use to develop, compile and test Debian GNU/Linux, you will need a
Linux distribution to use "mount -o loop"
Further needed programs:
	- gcc (>=4.X)
	- GNU make
	- makedepend
	- subversion (recommended)

----------Compiling

Change to this package directory and type:

	$ make

To customize the building process modify the not well documented Makefiles

----------Installing

Nupkux is pre-alpha software, which can be very harmful to your computer. 	
I recommend you to use a virtual machine for testing purposes, there is 
ANY WARRANTY for damage caused by Nupkux.
Good virtual machines:
	- Qemu (http://bellard.org/qemu)
	- VirtualBox (http://www.virtualbox.org)
	- Bochs (http://bochs.sourceforge.net)

So by default Nupkux is not installed on your real hard drive.
If you type as superuser:

	# make install
	
Nupkux and its userspace applications will be installed on a virtual
floppy drive. Mounting this drive need superuser-rights (root,sudo).

You will need an image of this floppy, which can be found at:

	http://prdownload.berlios.de/nupkux/bootdisk.img.gz

Qemu users can type:

	# make all install run_qemu
	
----------License

Nupkux comes under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3, as published
by the Free Software Foundation. You can find a copy at ./src/COPYING .
How ever, there are some parts, not written by me under other licenses,
often highly modified and not in a clear state of copyright.
Some of them are marked so, others not. I'm really sorry for this and hope
to line out the foreign parts soon.
